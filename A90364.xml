            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHat is there more regarded, or prevalent, amongſt Chriſtians (next to Divine oracle) Then the, <hi>extrema vox,</hi> the laſt language (as to Counſel and Inſtruction) of Gaſping and dying brethren and friends? And who ſees not the fainting, and now utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring condition, of this ſo long flouriſhing nation, (and glorious even to envy) of <hi>England,</hi> and its Dominions, and Territories? That twenty years ago, it was ſuch, and is at this preſent, thus; one penful of ink need not be ſpent to manifeſt, and illuſtrate the ſame: And ſeeing there is no right remedy will be looked after, or ſo much as thought on, by the preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Phyſicians, and Chirurgions, who take upon them the Cure; But ſuch potions, and plaiſters in preparation to be applied, as clearly, and without all queſton, will rather haſten its utter deſtruction, then aſſwage the leaſt pain: What then hath this poor hacknied, over-ridden, ſpurr'd, and ſpurgall'd people to do, but before their exſpiring Spirits be utterly ſpent, to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them with their utmoſt vigour, and cheerfully to advance their own <hi>Soveraign</hi> cure; from this deſperate malady, in ſuch a way, as (ſeeing the wily arts, and cunning of deluding men ſo fail with their falſe, vain, empty, and pretended helps.) The great preſerver of men, who loves and delights in juſt and righteous things, may yet Bow down his ear, and hear, hearken and be propitious to us, in this our deep Calamity and Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>How we came into this miſery it will be needleſs to enquire? <hi>Res ipſa loquitur:</hi> Such dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beginnings, which none can forget, could not in the judgment of all ſober and ſerious perſons, but be the production of ſuch horrid concluſions: Our caſe therefore muſt be taken as it is; and ſince ſo many ſorts of cures hath been attempted, ſo many Empericks have tryed their skill and cunning; ſo much Phlebotimy and Scarrification hath been uſed, and all to no purpoſe, but rather to encreaſe the dolour, and heighten the danger; why, may we not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to call for, and uſe this <hi>Soveraign</hi> cure, and medicine of our own? It is ſurely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, above the height of madneſs, and an inſtance, beyond all inſtance; That when ſo plainly manifeſt, and certain a remedy, is with ſuch facility to be had, that an utter periſhing ſhould rather be choſen, and endured, and that under the hands of ſuch pretenders to cure, who as (we know) They (or their like) were the firſt makers of the malady, ſo it is continued upon us, with all kind of torments, for no other end or cauſe, but meerly the private profit and ambition of ſome particular perſons our fellow Leigmen, who flinging off all thoughts of ſubjection, cannot (or at leaſt hitherto will not) endure any the leaſt ſound or whiſper, towards reverting to that Station where God hath placed them by their Birth-right, nor be ſatisfied neither, with any elevation leſs, then the abſolute power and Dominion over the Bodies, Lives, and Fortunes of their Brethren and fellow Subjects. And although that art hath been uſed by them, that Diabolical charming art, of ſeveral qualities and effects, dreadful to our memories, to ſtupifie our ſenſes, and draw us by degrees, into that Lethargie, which ſo long and ſo viſibly we have laboured under, whilſt theſe cunning operators, have tried all kind of experiments, which enter their own wild Fancies, according to the length of that Mad Worm, which crawls in their heads, and whirls them about to ſuch actings, as dayly we ſee, <hi>in Propatulo,</hi> produced to us, pretending to ſupple Tar, and medicine our ſoares; But really and indeed, for no other end, ſave, which of them ſhould be the chiefeſt ſhearers, to clip and fleece us, and ſet what mark upon us, and what Dogs to hunt us they pleaſe; Yet coming now to Excotiation, and tearing off from us our very skins, which (whatever fawning, ſtroking, and ſoothing is at preſent uſed, to make us lie ſtill, till our bonds and ſhackles, be faſt on, and tied cloſe, yet) all Inſtruments are at work for, and in a near readineſs for the action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:118420:3"/>Shall we Sheepiſhly ſtill bleat out our miſeries in a wretched Tone, and ſilently ſuffer this prepared rending us to deſtruction? ſhall not rather the Terrour and apprehenſion of our emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger and diſtreſs, rouze up your drouzy numneſs; And before the knife comes to our throats make uſe oft hem to utter this <hi>vocem extremam,</hi> and call out for our certain and undoubted remedy.</p>
            <p>Which as it is tacitely in the hearts, and whiſpers of all true <hi>Engliſh men,</hi> why ſhould it be kept cloſe between the teeth, and concealed from thoſe, who at preſent pretend to be our rulers, there being none more fit to know the general votes and deſires of the people, then they who in any kind repreſent them, or have pretence thereunto; and who (at leaſt ſome of them) may for ought we yet know to the contrary, be as ready and willing to hearken unto this general voice, and to advance this way of our remedy, cure, and deliverance, as our ſelves; why may we not then with open, loud, and extended voyce, utter this moſt earneſt vote and deſire of our very hearts and Souls. <hi>Let the Heir of the Crown be ſpeedily admitted, to his juſt rights, with all Honour, Freedome, and Safety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this voice onely, may do it, This now general voyce, and indeed loud cry, and clamour of all true hearted <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſuch as are free from all corrupt and ſiniſter ends, and reſpects whatſoever, may be liſtned to and take its wiſhed, and long look'd for effect, and ſo other means prevented, which elſe (it is to be feared) will undoubtedly be laid hold on: Let what enſueth be taken into ſerious and timely conſideration.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, leaſt it be objected, that what is here aſſerted, is not the general voyce, and deſire of the people; Let the oppoſers, put it upon what way of trial they dare: Although ('tis true) there hath been almoſt theſe twenty years, ſuch labour and pains taken, ſuch art and skill uſed, by all the wayes and means, which could enter the corrupt heart of man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, for the infecting and poyſoning the loyalty and obedience due from all ſorts, to his now <hi>Glorious</hi> father, and to him, h s undoubted Heir. Yet it is a moſt notorious and unqueſtionable truth, that upon what way or manner ſoever, Diviſion can be made, in general, Eight parts, at the leaſt, of Ten, throughout theſe whole Dominions, even of all ſorts, conditions and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, from the higheſt, to the loweſt, learned and unlearned, nay even of ſuch, who formerly were ſeduced to engage againſt his cauſe, are now as high and earneſt in this vote and deſire, as any his firſt and chiefeſt adherents; And were there full freedome and liberty given by ſuch as have uſurped the preſent power, for all perſons to uſe, and take their free choice therein, for every ſingle perſon of the oppoſers, there would be found at leaſt a thouſand contraveners; and of the Nobility, Gentry, and chief Burgers, in all places, the odds would be found far greater: If this be deemed but word onely, and fiction, let there be but licenſe given for publick votes, or ſubſcriptions, throughout the three Nations, with freedome and ſafety, (and as affairs ſtand, why ſhould this be denyed,) and if this truth doth not ſo manifeſtly appear, that there ſhall be no room for the leaſt doubt, then let an eternal ſilence and ſuffering be impoſed on thoſe who are marked out for h s chief adherents, and it is verily believed, there is not a man of them, but will readily aſſent unto it; and if this be true in fact, and certainly nothing can be more aſſuredly true, why ſhould it not be openly known and publiſhed, that (beſides what other effect it may work with all whom it concerns) we may (however) with fear and amazement conſider, what ſtrange Fate hangs over this people, and three Nations, that the whole Bulk and Body of them ſhould ſuffer terrour and ſubjugation, by ſo inconſiderable a party, of the number, who 'tis true (as matters are ordered) appear indeed like <hi>Alcibiades</hi> curtain, which was outwardly imbroidered with Eagles and Lions: But on the other ſide was nothing but meer Apes and Owles: If we be a free people (as it is ſaid we are) and the ſupremacy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited for breach of truſt, by the late King, and reverted to us, as ſome vainly prate and ſcrible, why ſhould we then (in ſuch caſe,) be denyed that, wherein onely this Freedome chiefly conſiſts, which is, that ſince this forfeiture, and the Seizure of the Supremacy into our hands, we may enjoy the free choyce of our Government and Governours, and that in ſuch a fair free and open way, That all who are to be obliged to ſubjection, may manifeſt their conſents unto it: Muſt we be told we are a free people, and yet muſt this be denyed us? Nay, when the worſt and baſeſt kind of ſlavery, that ever was in any age ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> impoſed on any ſort of men, is violently thruſt upon us, which is, to have an incompetent and inconſiderable number of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118420:3"/>
ſeeming Legiſlators, pickt out for us, ſome of them out of Corners and Goales, where they lay drenched in debt by luxury, and Ryot, and brought into play, (for indeed it ſeems no other, then a meer Pageantry) and that upon an old crackt title of election, almoſt twenty years ſtanding, and long before the pretended forfeiture, and ſeizure (if any ſuch were or could be,) and ſince that likewiſe, nulled, forfeited, ſurrendred, caſſed and voided, almoſt twenty ſeveral wayes, as (if it were <hi>Tonti,</hi> ſo do it) may by undenyable arguments be evidently made appear. Theſe men, or, what appellation can fitly be given them? for they come at the call of the the Souldiers, and make themſelves their ſlaves; And the Souldiers are, or ſhould be ſervants to the people, from whom they receive their wages, yet the people muſt be made ſlaves, to theſe their Servants ſlaves; here is ſuch a probleme of policy, and Delphick myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that it hath ſcarce any parallel, unleſs we call to mind, how the late Kings own power, was made uſe of, to ſeiſe away from him, his own treaſure, revenues, Ships, Caſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by vertue of that his own Power, armed men were raiſed to fight againſt his own perſon; nay, the King in one Army, was made to fight againſt himſelf in the contrary Army; Even ſo, this parcel of <hi>Pageantry,</hi> this ninth part of Ten (for more there ſcarce is not of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual number of ſuch an Aſſembly, and that onely of but one of the three Eſtates neither) act here their parts of Sitting, Voting, (and dropping Laws, like the Brood of <hi>Trochylus,</hi> Eggs and Birds in a moment,) and ſeemingly Domineering and Vaunting over us, their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves, themſelves the while, being under the iron whip alſo, and not daring to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing contrary to the ſenſe of their Maſters at <hi>Wallingford-houſe,</hi> or whereſoever elſe aſſembled, if otherwiſe <hi>Foris Abite,</hi> Out you go Sirs, to your Cells and Goayles again: Behold the freedome, and free State we have purchaſed ſo dearly, which hath been ſo long and now afreſh noiſed in our ears, and comes in a new ſhape and dreſs, and under a new name, <hi>The good old cauſe</hi> forſooth, which indeed is no other, then as the Badge or Teſſara, which is uſed amongſt Canting Gipſies, to underſtand one anothers minds, whileſt they in the mean time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude us, and pick our pockets. And moſt aſſuredly, whatſoever ſome fond people dream, of freedome, and a free ſtate, and ſuch empty vain whimſies, as long as their inchanters have prevalency over their weak braines, yet This, and ſuch like as this, is all the Freedome, and Free State, they are ever likely to ſee or enjoy; Nor is it any way imaginable to be otherwiſe, in the judgment of ſober and diſcerning perſons, who will ſeriouſly conſider the nature and diſpoſition of the generality of the people of theſe Nations, and the moſt excellent frame of Government, ſo long continued amongſt us, and by time refined, and perfected, and all ſorts, bred up, fitted and adapted to it; It being ſo rarely Tempered, and Moulded, that it retains the good, and rejects the ill, of all the known Governments exerciſed amongſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; That to tell us of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſuch like, The caſe upon due examination will be found as different (conſidering all circumſtances, in a juſt frame of Government, not to be omitted) as Heaven, is different from Hell, or Order from Confuſion; And that buſy, yet empty head, who now fancieth to reduce theſe Nations, into ſuch a frame, or any thing like it, generally ſatisfactory, may as well, and with the like diſcretion, endevour to make a rope of ſand, build a Caſtle in the air, or empty the Sea with his fiſt; No, here is ſuch a Capital peice of that Government, which (and which onely) is proper, and natural to us, out of joint; that ſalve the diſ-jointure, as well as we can, Annoint, Dreſs, and Bath it, Plaiſter, Swathe, and Bind it up, with all the art and cunning, can poſſibly be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and and Invented; the patient can never be out of moſt dolorous pain, till it be right ſet, and in juſt joynt again: And how that is to be effected, the now General Voyce tells us, <hi>Let the Heir of the Crown, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, it is to be conſidered, whether any obligation be of greater force then an Oath to the Lord: And who is it, even of thoſe likewiſe, which are the chiefeſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of ſuch his admittance, but hath ſolemnly plighted and ſworn faith and true alleigeance to this Heir; and upon ſuch an Oath, acknowledged him likewiſe in all Cauſes, and over all Perſons in his Dominions, ſupream Head and Governor: For is not faith plighted and alleigeance ſworn to the Heir in expreſs words, as well as to the Anceſtor? And is not that Heir in the inſtant of his Anceſtors expiration, by our Laws immediately, and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

And if new and contrary Oaths, Engagements, and Covenants, by what name or title ſoever called, for ſtore of them, there hath been indeed, and all kept alike; if theſe, or any of theſe be objected; There is no Orthodox Divine; but will tell them this truth (I am ſure true Divinity it ſelf will) that they being all unlawfully compacted, they are <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> voyd, and ſo far from binding the conſcience, that like the vow made by the Conſpirators againſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they ought to be repented of, and deteſted, as the grand crime, for which theſe direful confuſions have befallen us; there not being, or in poſſibility to be, any oath lawful againſt the firſt, nor can any ſubſequent act, or engagement made (though by all the people in general) be of force to quit, or abſolve from that firſt lawful oath, or from our native duty and alleigeance, which we are bound to, although the oath were never taken; And to teach otherwiſe (as too many have done, for their own wicked and corrupt ends) is as high a blaſphemy againſt God, and his Sacred Word, as almoſt can poſſibly be committed, and that Caitiffe (who ever he be) who for ſiniſter purpoſes, dares yet continue to inſinuate the contrary, let him tremble to think of that horror and confuſion, which will one day ſeize him, for advancing ſo deſperate, curſed, and diabolical a Doctrine; May hearty and timely repentance rather be his puniſhment; and in teſtimony thereof joyn with all good people, in this their now loud general voyce, <hi>Let the Heir of the Crown, &amp;c.</hi>

There being many made deſperate by exile, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers having made themſelves ſo, as loathing to live amongſt ſuch variety of wild humors, and frantick confuſions; and being of known and active parts and abilities, and ſuch as will not forget, <hi>Dulce natale ſolum, foelixque paterna haereditas,</hi> but labour without all defatigation, to recover both the one, and the other. Let Hiſtorians remember, and think of the exiles of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Millan,</hi> eſpecially the laſt, what hot work they made, and how terrible they grew at laſt, even to all ſorts, in the often revolution, in few years, of that Government; And can we think their chief Head and Soveraign (the Prince by general vote here ſo deſired) is or will be ever ſo aſleep; But as his intereſt is of the higheſt concernment, ſo will his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and endevors be probably every way anſwerable; and if he were extinct, another ſteps into his place, and title, perchance more active and better befriended then himſelf; and after him, another, and another, to the end of two numerous and apparent Stems; Beſides the fourteen titles the Jeſuit found out, to the Crown here, in the dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And which of them was made to have the firſt Soveraign title, is legible enough. It is certainly little leſſe then miraculous, to ſee ſome men blinded, by intereſt (profit or ambition, or both having ſeized their faculties) with what confidence, they ſeem to aſſure themſelves of the impoſſibilty of the appearing of any cloud, (eſpecially from Sea-ward) to eclipſe their Sun ſhine; But fanſie that all things muſt needs go on, as their bribed ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſters dictate to them: Surely were theſe men but as converſant in the Hiſtory of other Times, and Nations, as they are in the myſtery of their own iniquities, they would ſoon depoſe and quit this confidence: All men of ſober, ſolid, and unbyaſſed reaſon and judgements, when they conſider the various and dangerous factions, and parties at home; the murmurs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, envies, and emulations every where abounding amongſt us, what a vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude there is of men, and humors ſtirring, and heaving in all places, and ſome probable enough, even there and amongſt thoſe, where the beſt and greateſt ſecurity is thought and expected; when there are ſuch perſons of intereſt, and active operation abroad, headed and aſſiſted by ſuch a number of illuſtrious and heroick Princes, whoſe high intereſt, both here, and abroad, will never want Agents, Emiſſaries, and Inſtruments, both there and here, even in places, and amongſt perſons, where they are leaſt thought on, or imagined.

And this (whatſoever may be vainly ſurmiſed to the contrary) no way by the wit and policy of man (as our caſe ſtands) to be prevented, the generality of the people likewiſe, ſo fixed to, and longing for their Native Soveraign. I ſay, any ſober man who conſiders this, may (without the help of hiſtorical examples (of which there are ſtore enough in far more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and deſperate caſes) very reaſonably, and with confidence enough too, conclude, that our <hi>Eutopian</hi> free State, or Commonwealth, of which there hath been ſuch a deal of noyſe and rumor, made ſuch ſhifting, heaving, and ſhoving to get up, will quickly totter, fall, and lie flat upon its face, or its no face rather; and by that time, thoſe, who are now upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, have acted their part, and made their ſale (for every power muſt have its pilladge) will there ('tis believed) be tymber enough left, in all our Forreſts, and Chaſes, to make ſo much as a Toole towards its Re-erection, or the leaſt ſhore, or prop for its ſuſtentation. Let us not cozen and deceive one another, nor our ſelves neither, our caſe is ſuch, if duly conſidered, and weighed in the ballance of right reaſon; this flatuous empty bubble, and conceit of a free State, (being the <hi>ultimum refugium</hi> of thoſe many Jeſuitical deſigns which have been ſo long practiſed upon us, and if it take effect in any ſort, their very maſter peece for our diviſion, and deſtruction, as is fully by ſeveral pens manifeſted to us, and ſuch who will not ſee it, muſt needs be wilfully blind) cannot but render us and our Iſland (that which long with eagerneſs hath been gaped after) a publick and open prey to our inveterate and popiſh enemies, and utterly overwhelm and bury us in own ruins and deſolation; nor can there be any remedy to relieve us, but a ſpeedy hearkning to, and approving this now general voice; <hi>Let the Heir of the Crown, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Nor is the Birth, Perſon, and Parts of this Royal Prince to be omitted in our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being ſuch as would put the whole Chriſtian world, upon ſome difficulty, to find his Parallel, or equal in all reſpects: His birth and extraction is ſo tranſcendently illuſtrious, that what Prince is there upon earth, who can challenge a greater, or more noble, and Kingly, and of longer continuance, for centuries of years? His Perſon ſo lovely and amiable, that (if publick report be at all to be credited) it ſtrikes a kind of wonder, and amazement to all beholders, and every where generates a noble clemency, even from the chiefeſt enemies of his Anceſtors, and of our Nation and Dominions: His parts and endowments ſuch, as were we free from all ſubjection to him by all Laws, and to make ſearch, through all people and Nations, for a compleat and well accompliſhed perſonage to rule over us, common fame and report could not but ſend us to him; ſo meek, gentle, and ſweet of behaviour; ſo firm, conſtant, and obliging in his friendſhips; ſo modeſt, and patient in his afflictions and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; yet upon juſt occaſion ſo full of Princely courage and magnanimity; ſo knowing, and diſcerning in his reaſon, and judgement, and by his retirement ſo fitted, and adopted for moderate Government; But above all, ſo firmely and irremoveably fixed to the profeſſion of the true Proteſtant Religion, teſtified many wayes againſt the cunning arts, and ſubtle attempts, and allurements of the moſt inveterate enemies thereof; That it is an infamy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be waſhed off from this Nation (unleſs this general vote and deſire be hearkned to, and take effect in ſuch manner as may in ſome ſort purge the ſame) that ſuch a Prince as he, ſo quallified in all reſpects, and ſo innocent likewiſe, as to the firſt cauſe of difference; and ever ſince alſo, ſaving his deſire and purſuance of his juſt and undoubted Birth-right; a thing which the meaneſt of us, would be condemned by all, even by our very ſelves, ſhould we omit or be negligent of, were it but for a poor Cottage: I ſay, that ſuch a Prince as he, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his heroick and high born Brethren, (all of them, even in this their eclipſed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, the very Crown and Glory of our Nations) ſhould be chaſed from ſuch an ample and ſplendid fortune, and patrimony, and that by his own Native Subjects, and Leige peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſuffered to wander, nay by their means, hunted from place to place, from one Nation to another People, and forced to live upon the alms, and charity, as it were, of thoſe, who are not without (but have had a long time) their grand deſigns, upon him, us, and all his Dominions, as (it may be feared) time will too ſoon manifeſt; Beſides the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting him, and that whole Royal Race, by this means, to the enticements and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to the ſtratagems, nets, and entanglements, of thoſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> rooking Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who are ranging in all parts for their prey, and will be ſure to leave no ſtone unmoved

to work their wicked ends, where ſuch a Quarry of Royal Game is to be flown at, and with ſuch advantage (as the caſe ſtands with them) to be attempted, that the very contemplation of it, cannot me thinks, but draw tears from the eyes, and almoſt blood from the hearts of all pious, loyal, Proteſtant Chriſtians, who have any ſence, and feeling, as they ought, of that deep diſhonour, and reproach, which by this very means, muſt needs redound to the Profeſſors of the true Proteſtant Religion, in all parts, and places whatſoever, and no leſs ſport and paſtime, to the great Vicar general of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Court and Conclave: But as in the ground where Gold grows, nothing ('tis ſaid) will thrive but Gold; ſo God hath hitherto preſerved, this vertuous Prince, moſt firm, ſound, and entire, in the true Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Faith, and no doubt but will ſo continue him, and make him not only in title, but really and indeed a Magnanimous Defender thereof, againſt all its Adverſaries; And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, were it not too true, that <hi>Romiſh</hi> cunning deſigns, and ſubtle Jeſuited infuſions are too prevalent; It is impoſſible there ſhould be the leaſt deafneſs to, but a ready and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful compliance with this voice, this now general voice: <hi>Let the Heir, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>And whereas the moſt perplexed and knotty trouble, of this great buſineſs, ſeems to be the ſatisfaction and content, which may be expected from this Prince, to all thoſe deſcent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties, and Brethren of the Reformation, who are poſſeſſed of, and enjoy ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, in the matter and manner of their Religion, and the excerciſe and practice thereof: Let ſuch in the firſt place, but conſider this truth, which is ſo viſible, and hath ſo often in our late revolutions, been experimented, that they have an indulgence indeed allowed them, by the ſeveral, at preſent, uppermoſt Powers; But why? Can they poſſibly be ſo blind, as not to ſee; It is only and meerly for their own ends and aims? For as by ſoothing and fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, they aſpire by their help, and upon their backs, to get to their ſeveral high ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo by that means, they have hope alwayes ſo to continue, eſpecially (which hath been the great art of our late Grandees) if they can but divide them into Parties, Sects, and Factions enough: <hi>Divide &amp; Impera,</hi> being alwayes the Uſurpers <hi>Motto,</hi> for by the ſtrong breath of ſuch diviſions, they ſoar, and hover aloft over all, feeding all Parties with empty hopes, but really intending only the ſuppertation of their own Grandieur; and this, this only it is, which makes ſo many great men in power, publick Preachers, and prayers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the poor deluded common people, who look upon them, as ſo many Saints, and Angels of light ſent from Heaven, when he that ſits in Heaven, and ſees into the heart, knows, they are thereby only advancing their own deeds of darkneſs, profit, and Ambition. And it hath been notorious enough, that when ſome of this ſort, have climed, and got high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, by the means of ſuch ſtalking horſes, and ſcaling ladders, they have preſently docked them, and broken them to peeces; and can theſe people, or any ſort of them, aſſure themſelves of other uſage, from any of our new <hi>Ambi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Surely they cannot, for that which this day is the intereſt, of this, or that great man in power and eſteem; to morrow perchance he ſees cauſe, it ſhould be quite contrary, and then are all his ſmoke-fed Clients, to ſeek for a new Patron: Nay, though ſome ſort of theſe poor deluded perſons, have been ſo long led on, with hopes that they have even ſeemed to reach the top and height of their wiſhes, on a ſuddain, they are tumbled down again into the very depth of diſpair: And what then is the mode and guiſe now in faſhion, and uſe, for this particular? Why a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick humiliation, or two, will do it, and a ſhort ſtory told of ſeeming ſenſibleneſs for back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding, and then all they think is well, and whole again, and the Grandees may go afreſh to work, upon a new ſcore and intereſt, and (if their old ones will not ſerve their turn) troal about for new Clients, for in theſe changing and disjoynted times, there is ſtore enough (they know) to be had any where; Although it may very well be remembred, and is not eaſily to be forgotten; how that for far leſs crimes, then what they are pleaſed to call but backſliding in themſelves: Nay, for that indeed, which was ſo far from a crime, that it was a duty, a ſtrict duty enjoyned by all the Laws of God, Nature, and the Land: How many thouſands have been by them fiercely proſecuted, as the worſt of Rebels and Traytors, and many hundreds of them torn quite in peeces, and utterly ruined and deſtroyed; the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118420:6"/>
whole publick affairs, whether of Church, State, or Common-wealth, ever ſince the firſt revolt, and diſmal disjoynture, have been droven on, by ſuch ſeveral ſhifted Charioteers, and with ſuch aufracts, windings, and viciſſitudes, and ſo likely never to be otherwiſe; that there neither is, nor can be, the leaſt hope of ſetled aſſurance of any matter, or thing whatſoever; it all, indeed being nohting els, but, as it were, a meer Maze, from which, there is no way to come out, but at the ſame place we began to enter in. Now if theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſwaded Parties in matters of Religion, and its exerciſe and practiſe, would but due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, and throughly underſtand their own true intereſt, there would be nothing more deteſtable to them, then to depend upon ſuch variable, and tranſitory uncertanties, or to have further traffique, or dealing with any ſuch kind of Merchants in Religion, who Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker like, as they ſerve an old cloak, can dreſs it, trigge, and turn it, as they liſt, and when they pleaſe diſguiſe it with a new cape or facing. For where or from whom can they poſſibly expect or hope for a more certain and ſetled aſſurance of enjoying a free exerciſe of the Reformed Religion, and that according to their perſwaſions, being modeſt and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (which is all they ſeem to deſire and aym at) then under him, and his protection, who is ſo firmly fixed to it, and for whoſe ſake he hath ſo long and ſo largely taſted the bittereſt cup of affliction, that ſince that bleſſed Reformation firſt made, ever happened to the lot of any Prince, that profeſſed it: Beſides, he is their Father, their common Father, and Soveraign, and (without great want of charity) cannot be imagined (eſpecially after ſuch his own manifold ſufferings) but to be moſt tender bowelled to his Children, and Subjects, in whatſoever can with any modeſty or reaſon, be deſired from him. There is ſurely no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, protection, or indulgence, can be comparable to his; freed from all plots, labours, and contrivances for its obtaining, and continuing; Nor no ſuch certainty of enjoyment thereof, and of all other juſt liberty whatſoever, as is to be had by, and under him, whoſe cheif Intereſt is the publick peace and quiet of his Dominions, and the contenting and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of all parties, who are now purpoſely, and by art, and cunning, kept in diſcontent, odds, and difference, for the ends of others, their ſeveral patrons, who are thereby ſuſtained in Repute and Eſteem, according to the number of their Clients, and Proſelytes; And who can in a moment (as things happen) vary their Intereſt and Clients too, and leave them in the lurch, for a new cheat and dreſſing. This his Intereſt alſo, is ever one and the ſame, and ſubject to no variation in that particular; and his tranſcendent quality ſuch, that it would be far beneath his honour and dignity, to put the leſt deluſion upon any ſort of Subjects whatſoever. His undoubted Title to the Soveraignty, and to this protection, ſuch likewiſe, that publick Aſſemblies (if need be) for conferences, and debates between diſſenting Parties, and Brethren, may freely and fully be had, and differences perhaps thereby well quieted and ſetled, to the content and ſatisfaction of all, which our Grandees muſt not, nor cannot endure, for fear diviſions in that kind ſhould ceaſe, and ſo their Empire and Dominion by that means determine. There might much more be ſaid as to this particular, concerning theſe differing parties, and that to their more ample and full content and ſatisfaction: But brevity befits this Paper, and if permitted, it may be done as ſeaſonably hereafter, this little may give them a hint, that none more then they have reaſon to advance this general voyce, <hi>Let the Heir, &amp;c.</hi>

To give but a ſmall hint concerning one particular, which (as <hi>inſtar omnium</hi>) may illuſtrate to us the ſame reaſon in all others, and that is the particular of the purſe, and the vaſt ſums, which are ſo frequently and violently exacted, and torn from all ſorts, and ſome (and thoſe moſt) who want it for bread, to feed their Families; eſpecially now the deadneſs of trade, and all other chearful and uſual wayes to advance livelihood, and ſupport, being ſuch, that every mans heart is become quite ſunk towards them, each honeſt man looking like his ſouls coffin; no life, no chearfulneſs, no encouragement, to ought that is either good or advantagious, to himſelf or others of inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour rank, who might elſe have help and ſupport from him, and the cauſe of this every one hath in his mouth: <hi>Why, the times are ſuch, and ſo unſetled, &amp;c.</hi> Nor can it poſſibly be imagined to be otherwiſe, with the Body, and Members, whilſt the Head continues in the caſe it is; ſet that right, in its place, and all perſons, and things elſe are inſtantly ſetled with it. <hi>Faci' è res redit ad ſuam naturam,</hi> is a rule, as true, as old, perchance, ſome one general large contribution may be needful, and what pious and peaceable ſoul is there, who would not moſt willingly and chearfully purchaſe ſuch a laſting peace, and ſettlement, at ſuch a rate, which indeed will be but ſmall, and inconſiderable, to thoſe vaſt ſums which are now ſo frequently exhauſted. The total whereof, ſince the People of theſe Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their fellow-ſubjects ſponges; it would puzzle Arithmatick it ſelf, to caſt up, and although the ſums collected have been ſo vaſt, and ample, almoſt to infinity, yet the <hi>Souldier</hi> unpaid, the <hi>Navy</hi> unpaid, and the <hi>Publick</hi> (as 'tis ſaid) millions in debt, and ſo hath it been for the moſt part all along, ſince the firſt direful revolt, and ſo will it ever be: No thoughts, no hopes are admiſſible to the contrary, whilſt this <hi>Chymera</hi> of ſetling a Free State, here, floats in the brains of ſuch in power, who tels us, in print, that it will be a braſs wall againſt the claim of the Heir, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it may with more piety and policy alſo be told them, who vainly ſo imagine; that the beſt braſs wall is a good conſcience, <hi>Murus Aeneas ſana Conſcientia,</hi> and that if they keep not that braſs wall, they ſpeak of, perpetually lined with ſilver, and gold too, and that in ſuch quantity, as will not long be to be had, or found in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Free State, the leaſt pelt of a pot gun will lay it in the duſt, to which condition them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all of us, muſt one day be reduced; and how near that day is, none knows, but he that knows all things; therefore it were ſurely far better, and ſafer to look to our ſtate in the other world, and not trouble, and buſie our ſelves to erect new States here, in this; which if the great diſpoſer of all things, would put into the heart of thoſe now in power (who ever they be) to do, (and doubtleſs he would, if they would but truly and rightly ſeek him) how quiet and happy would all our States be preſently here, and our eternal ſtate more certainly bleſſed hereafter: In ſo doing, this great <hi>Remora,</hi> and obſtacle, their diſpair of ſecurity, would alſo vaniſh, which having no ground to ſupport it, but what is uſual in ſuch caſe, Guilt and Crime, if they be recanted and purged by ſuch a teſtimony, as may now be given, what ſhould hinder, but that the greateſt ſecurity in the world may <hi>Hincinde,</hi> be both given and taken; and reſpect and favour had to, as the caſe may well deſerve; if Forraign Hiſtory be conſulted, it is not altogether barren of examples even to all particulars, nor here at home neither, one particular excepted: And for that particular, <hi>Id nefandum quidem,</hi> it is believed, there is but one or two Perſons, now left in the Nation, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability may be charged with the real guilt thereof: And it is not impoſſible neither, but that thoſe very Perſons alſo may be left to the great and high Tribunal: And as God is a moſt merciful God, ſo we are on all hands aſſured, we may (if we will) have a moſt cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and merciful Vicegerent of his over us, and in ſuch a way and manner, as may yet render us all of all ſorts and perſwaſions, Parties and Factions, the moſt felicitous of all Nations whatſoever; whereas, if this fair opportunity be overſlipped, and forraign force,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118420:7"/>
and power be neceſſitated to be made uſe of, (and aſſuredly that cannot alwayes be wanting to ſuch a Perſon and Title, and how ſoon it may be offered, nay preſſed upon him, may without much difficulty be gueſſed at) what pen is able to expreſſe the miſery and calamity, which may in all probability befal us all in general; but eſpecially thoſe, whoſe obdurate ſtiffneſs is ſuch, that although they may yet eaſily prevent this, yet will not, but clearly manifeſt, they care not though all be on fire rather, for ſo perhaps they think they may warm their hands at, and ſlip away by the light of it: For mine own part, I do here publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that this particular of forraign force never enters my thoughts, knowing by the help of Hiſtory, what diſmal uſe hath been made of it, in many places abroad, and even here at home with us alſo: But ſuch ſpectacles of horrour are repreſented to me, that I may in a manner truly utter the Poets Language of another, <hi>Obſtupui, ſteteruntque comae.</hi> Nay, at this preſent me thinks my Pen drops blood, fearing the iniquities of this Nation are ſo far from being chaſtiſed enough, that our ſinful account is now in many reſpects become larger then ever, and perceiving ſuch ſtiff wilfulneſſe in ſome, and ſuch ſecurity in others, and vain confidence in carrying on, and effecting what their deluſions prompt them to, that my very ſoul melts within me, and poures it ſelf out before the Lord, that he may yet (if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) be entreated, there may not be one drop of bloud more ſpilt in this difference; there hath been too much, too too much already of all ſorts, from the higheſt to the loweſt, that when inquiſition comes to be made for blood (and that time will moſt aſſuredly come,) who almoſt is it, that can truly plead otherwiſe then guilty, before that Great, and All-ſeeing, and All-ſearching Viſitor? And therefore that iſſue of all others ſhould be ſtopt, and the iſſue now in general vote (none better, nor more happy for all parties) layd hold on, and take effect, which (if the Lord have yet any mercy for us) may be ſpeedily, and chearfully accompliſhed, and ſo a laſting, and firm peace indeed be had and obtained, with ſafety enough on all ſides, and to the joy of all hearts, ſave ſuch, whoſe minds and affections are totally given up, and devoted to miſchief, blood, and ruine, and care not though all periſh, and ſink, ſo they may but keep themſelves aloft, and ſwimming: But I will yet hope better things of ſuch as are (or pretend to be) in Place, and Power: Be that Power in Chief where it will, either at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> or <hi>Wallingford</hi> Houſe. And to thoſe Gentlemen now ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> although whatſoever is expreſſed in the premiſes, as touching their tenuous aſſembly in general, and their uſurped authority by it, or may reflect upon any perſon of them in particular, it is even now become almoſt the general language of all men, and that in the very open ſtreets, and (as 'tis ſaid) even in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages alſo: And therefore Ingenuity obligeth them not to be offended with ſuch, who by this means (for no other is poſſible to be had, nor this neither without danger) tell them that of themſelves, which otherwiſe (as their caſe ſtands) they would probably be ignorant of, being chiefly converſant amongſt themſelves onely, and vainly nurturing, and cheriſhing up up one another, in their own (ſeeming to them weighty, but really and indeed) empty and frivolous conceits and imaginations. The generality of the people in all places being fixedly ſet againſt them, which, upon any trial whatſoever, they will be ſure to find true, and none almoſt (eſpecially of ſober rank and quality) ſpeaking of them, but with grief, contempt, and diſdain for ſuch their high preſumption to come, ſit and act upon thoſe Terms, and in that manner, as they ſeem to undertake, to the perpetual diſhonour, and infamy of thoſe great, high, and honourable conventions, and the peoples juſt right of election thereto: Nor any at all owning them, but either a thin herd of known brainſick zelots, and thoſe of very little, or no repute, and of farre leſs intereſt in the Nation; or elſe ſuch, as to gratifie their own revenge and malice, or for ſome ſiniſter end or other, take the preſent opportunity, to lay hold on any power weatſoever, to ſerve their own turns. Though at the very ſame time they diſdain it in their hearts; and the next day, would upon any occaſion, be as ready to fly into the face of it, to its ruine, as this day, they are to ſollicite it for their own ends: And to know this, and be certainly informed of it, is, or ſhould be, as conſiderable to them in the Station they ſtand in, and as kindly taken too, may well be thought, as ought elſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, which is deſirable to them, which, and which onely, together with the premiſed reaſons, why themſelves ſhould now joyn, and cloſe with the hearty, and moſt general votes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118420:7"/>
of the people, is the end and aim of this Paper: However this be ſo, yet for mine own part I cannot but look upon, and conſider them, or indeed, any other Aſſembly of men, be they what they will, whoſe power, intereſt, and influence is ſuch, as to be able to do, either very much good, or much more harm; I ſay, I cannot but look upon them, with ſuch reſpect and due regard, as becometh our preſent caſe condition: And tell them alſo this Truth, that it is a kind of honour (be it happened to them by Providence, or what elſe they pleaſe to call it) to have it in their hands (if their Power be ſuch as they pretend to) to obliege moſt firmly to them the hearts, lives, and fortunes of far the moſt inconſiderable part of the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and indeed of all in generall, who cannot but be included in that happineſs, which in this conjuncture of time with ſo much renown and ſecurity to themſelves, and triumphant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of all peaceable minds, and loyal hearts, they may now with ſuch facility obtain for them; and ſuch a Ray of Honour as (if ſlighted) will very probably never dawn, or in the leaſt glympſe thereof appear again to them: And this upon good grounds may further be ſaid likewiſe, That if the great God of Peace, ſhall in his mercy be pleaſed to encline their hearts to this way of Peace ſo much deſired and longed for, it may with full confidence be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly relyed on by them, that the leaſt hair of any of their heads ſhall be ſo far from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that ſuch of them who ſhall appear moſt forward and inſtrumental therein, may have what ſecurity they pleaſe to bear what ſhare or place they pleaſe in this our ſuch reſtored happineſs, which with any candor or modeſty can be expected or deſired by them; nor would it be grudged them by any perſon whatſoever, whom they imagine therein their chiefeſt male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volents and regrettors; for who can think them honoured too much, or preferred too high, who (as the caſe ſtands) and after ſo long and tedious a ſtorm, can or ſhall without blood, reſtore to three Nations that calm and happineſs of peace and ſettlement, which otherwiſe may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps coſt thouſands of precious lives, beſides the neceſſitated ruine, terrour and aſtoniſhment which in all probability muſt prevent and go before it: I am ſure it may with certainty be aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of ſome, and upon very good grounds the ſame alſo may be aſſerted of many: And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be thouſands, even many thouſands of the ſame pious mind likewiſe, who are ſo far from aſpiring and revenging thoughts thereby, that to ſee that gladſome day of our Soveraigns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his juſt rights with honour and ſafety, that thereby a ſure and laſting Peace may be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amongſt us, and ſo derived to our poſterities, would moſt readily ſacrifice their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fortunes, (and moſt of them no contemptible ones neither) yea, and their very lives too, and cheerfully chant out their laſt <hi>Nunc dimittis, &amp;c.</hi> And for thoſe Gentlemen of the Sword, who are as highly concerned in this particular as any perſons elſe whatſoever, it is ſo cleerly their intereſt to effect what is thus generally deſired, that if <hi>Cimmerian</hi> darkneſs be not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, nothing under heaven can be more apparent and manifeſt to them; for they cannot ſurely but ſee the uncertain condition they now ſtand in, under what general diſdain and odium to their Countrey they live; how often they are put to act the part of <hi>Italian</hi> Bravades, and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Janizaries, for ſome vile and corrupt intereſt or other; how unfixed and unſtable their ſtations are, what deſignes are perpetually upon all or ſome chief of them: To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the preſent deſigne, now generally in talk and apprehenſion, Where and in whoſe hands the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Nations is to be placed, and what the intended effect and purpoſe thereby is; how frequently they are made inſtruments of deſtruction to their fellow Brethren and Subjects, and often to trip up, and ſometimes to deſtroy one another: And to add to all this, and ten times more which may be ſaid, their Pay, which alwayes is collected from the People long before it is due, many times is ſubducted from them, and drawn into other chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, perhaps into private purſes, and that to ſuch as are their chief capital enemies: This and much worſe is their preſent ſtate and condition; whereas, if they be inſtrumental to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance this general vote and deſire of the people, that it might thereby take effect; they would render themſelves the very Darlings of the People, and thoſe general hearts which now have them in moſt odium and diſdain, will be ſo open and united to them, that they would even quite empty themſelves for a juſt remuneration for them, nothing can any way ſtick upon them of former ſully, but this way would be cleerly and abſolutely wiped off, and their fame and renown for ſo juſt and loyal an action to their native Soveraign, lovely ſound, not onely through this Iſland, but through the whole Chriſtian world, and merit even trophies of ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118420:8"/>
to be erected to them, that their juſt praiſe and exaltation may never endingly continue. There would in this caſe of ſuch return to their loyalty, and giving ſuch undoubted teſtimony of it, be certainty of Permanency for them, certainty of due Pay, certainty of Honour, and from the higheſt to the loweſt of them, certainty of juſt and full content and ſatisfaction, for preferment and otherwiſe, which their own hearts and deſires can with any modeſty wiſh and ſuggeſt to them: Nothing of which can be had, or ſo much as in the leaſt kind hoped for (what ever vain and empty Chymera's are inſinuated to them by thoſe whoſe ends they ſerve) in that frail and fluctuating condition they now ſtand in, and in which, the way they are in, they cannot but look ever to continue. Nor is all this meer words and fiction neither, but will be really and undoubtedly made good; nay, (if need be) ſecured for by ſuch ways and means as ſhall be ſubject to no juſt exception whatſoever, unleſs they will degenerate from that noble confidence which is or ought alwayes to be refulgent in men of honour, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Tribe, eſpecially when they have to deal with a perſon of ſuch high honour and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and he their own native Soveraign, and who is not in condition to deceive them, nor need they indeed be deceived, but have (if they pleaſe) their remedy in their own hands and power: Upon which grounds it is with great reaſon hoped that they will not be out at, but upon due conſideration of the premiſes will above all others advance this now general voyce, <hi>Let the Heir,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I intended far more brevity, and fear I have been too tedious, yet are there many things as much, and ſome perhaps more conſiderable than what is premiſed, inviting all people of all ſorts and conditions, who may ſeem in any way to be opponent to it, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly to joyn in advancing this firm and ſure ſettling way of a laſting peace, and happineſs in our Nations, eſpecially thoſe who now in Aſſembly take upon them to be repreſentatives, and if ſo, certainly no duty can be more incumbent upon ſuch, then to liſten to, and accompliſh the general vote and deſire of thoſe, whoſe perſons they ſo take upon them to repreſent; this certainly, is a main and chief part of their errand, upon which they were firſt ſent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by them; And for which, they can pretend to any Aſſemblies, or meetings upon the ſcore of the people: The peoples general votes and deſires, they hereby know, and may have further, full, ample, and aſſured ſatisfaction that it is ſo; if they will (and that as ſpeedily as they pleaſe) freely permit that particular to be put into any unqueſtionable way, or order, for ſuch their more full and plenary ſatisfaction and aſſurance. Nor can they upon any account whatſoever, before God, Angels, and Men, (even by their own wayes and grounds they go on (be they juſt or unjuſt) and according to their own inſinuations of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to them) deny the people this their moſt reaſonable requeſt, that as they take upon them to be their Repreſentatives, ſo they would give them free leave, and that without any awe, or dread whatſover to be upon them, freely to expreſs their minds and deſires, what they would have ſuch their Repreſenters do: If this be denied, ſlighted, or omitted, what caſe the people ſtand in, will ſurely then be moſt clear and manifeſt, and how can it then be otherwiſe deemed by all (even ſuch who at preſent may perhaps have ſome good thoughts of them) but that their own conſciences fully dictate to them the real truth of whatſoever is herein before aſſerted. To which conſciences of theirs, it is herein likewiſe appealed in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is before expreſſed, the ſincere dictates of which (freed from, and unbribed by corrupt and ſiniſter ends) if they will neither follow, nor yet hearken to theſe loud and general cries and clamors of the people, whom they would be thought thus to repreſent, but keep them ſtill in terrors, bonds, and chains, to be lead captive, as they liſt, and whether they liſt at their own few wils and pleaſures; then <hi>Hear you O Heavens, and hearken O Earth,</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> the great God and framer of them both, manifeſt thine own power and might, and cauſe thou both Heaven and Earth, and all thy whole creation amongſt us, in their courſes ſpeedily to aſſiſt and help us, and thy own appointed Vicegerent over us, to this juſt way of peace, and firm ſettlement ſo much and ſo long thirſted after by us. <hi>Pity, O pity thou</hi> our diſpiſed Church, diſtracted State, and even gaſping Common-weale, and let thine own outſtretched arm, by ſuch thine own means, as thou knoweſt beſt, ſpeedily in this thine own ordained way, Heal up theſe our wounds, and waſting diviſions, which (in ſuch caſe) none indeed but thine own
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118420:8"/>
hands can cloſe. Pluck us out from this <hi>Romiſh</hi> and Jeſuitical deep Pit, which is thus digging and preparing for us. And open the eyes of all ſeduced and deluded perſons, who cannot ſee, and melt the hearrs of the moſt obſtinate and perverſe, who will not ſee, this their common, open, and apparent danger; and be mercifull <hi>O Lord,</hi> yet be merciful unto them, and let not their tranſcendent crimes appear againſt them, at that great and dreadful day of account; Nor <hi>This Paper</hi> (if ſlighted) neither to their utter and everlaſting aſtoniſhment and confuſion.</p>
